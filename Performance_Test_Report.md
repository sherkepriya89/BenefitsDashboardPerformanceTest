# Performance Test of Benefits Dashboard API

## Project Overview
This project contains a simple performance test created using Apache JMeter for the Benefits Dashboard API. The test is designed to be gentle and is intended to demonstrate basic performance testing practices rather than stress testing the application.

## Test Details
- **Tool Used**: Apache JMeter
- **Number of Threads (Users)**: 10
- **Ramp-Up Period**: 1 second
- **Thread Lifetime**: 60 seconds
- **Constant Timer**: 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
- **Test Duration**: 60 seconds

### API Endpoints Tested
1. **GetEmployees**: Retrieves a list of employees.
2. **AddEmployee**: Adds a new employee.
3. **EditEmployee**: Edits an existing employee's details.
4. **DeleteEmployee**: Deletes an employee.

## Files Included
- `PerformanceTest.jmx`: The JMeter test plan used for the performance test.
- `results_screenshot.png`: A screenshot of the test results.
- `summary.csv`: The summary of test results generated by JMeter.

## How to Run the Test
1. **Open JMeter**: Launch JMeter and load the `PerformanceTest.jmx` file.
2. **Run the Test**: Click the start button to run the test.
3. **View Results**: Use the provided listeners in the JMX file to view and analyze the results.

## Submission
Please find the test plan, results screenshot, and the summary CSV file in this repository.

### Summary of Results

| API Endpoint    | # Samples | Average Response Time (ms) | Min Response Time (ms) | Max Response Time (ms) | Std. Dev. (ms) | Throughput (requests/sec) |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| GetEmployees    | 120       | 660                        | 104                    | 6618                   | 1649.55        | 2.12                     |
| AddEmployee     | 120       | 116                        | 60                     | 382                    | 59.52          | 2.39                     |
| EditEmployee    | 120       | 119                        | 62                     | 261                    | 33.92          | 2.39                     |
| DeleteEmployee  | 110       | 107                        | 58                     | 212                    | 31.59          | 2.41                     |
| **Total/Average**| **470**  | **254**                    | **58**                 | **6618**               | **867.68**     | **7.98**                 |

### Analysis of Results

1. **GetEmployees Endpoint**:
   - The average response time is relatively high at 660 ms, with significant variation (standard deviation: 1649.55 ms). This suggests that there might be occasional delays or performance bottlenecks in retrieving the employee list.
   - The maximum response time was very high at 6618 ms, indicating that some requests were extremely slow.

2. **AddEmployee Endpoint**:
   - This endpoint performed well with an average response time of 116 ms. The throughput was 2.39 requests per second, which is consistent and reliable.

3. **EditEmployee Endpoint**:
   - The performance was similar to the AddEmployee endpoint, with an average response time of 119 ms and a throughput of 2.39 requests per second.

4. **DeleteEmployee Endpoint**:
   - This endpoint showed the best performance, with an average response time of 107 ms and a throughput of 2.41 requests per second.

5. **Overall Performance**:
   - The overall average response time across all endpoints was 254 ms, with a throughput of 7.98 requests per second.
   - The GetEmployees endpoint may require optimization due to its significantly higher response times compared to other endpoints.

### Recommendations
- **GetEmployees Endpoint**: Investigate the cause of the high maximum response time and consider optimizing database queries or server-side processing.
- **Load Testing**: Consider conducting further load testing with more users to identify potential scalability issues.
- **API Optimization**: Review the API endpoints for possible improvements in performance, especially focusing on reducing the standard deviation in response times.
