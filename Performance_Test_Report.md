### Analysis of Results

1. **GetEmployees Endpoint**:
   - The average response time is relatively high at 660 ms, with significant variation (standard deviation: 1649.55 ms). This suggests that there might be occasional delays or performance bottlenecks in retrieving the employee list.
   - The maximum response time was very high at 6618 ms, indicating that some requests were extremely slow.

2. **AddEmployee Endpoint**:
   - This endpoint performed well with an average response time of 116 ms. The throughput was 2.39 requests per second, which is consistent and reliable.

3. **EditEmployee Endpoint**:
   - The performance was similar to the AddEmployee endpoint, with an average response time of 119 ms and a throughput of 2.39 requests per second.

4. **DeleteEmployee Endpoint**:
   - This endpoint showed the best performance, with an average response time of 107 ms and a throughput of 2.41 requests per second.

5. **Overall Performance**:
   - The overall average response time across all endpoints was 254 ms, with a throughput of 7.98 requests per second.
   - The GetEmployees endpoint may require optimization due to its significantly higher response times compared to other endpoints.

### Recommendations
- **GetEmployees Endpoint**: Investigate the cause of the high maximum response time and consider optimizing database queries or server-side processing.
- **Load Testing**: Consider conducting further load testing with more users to identify potential scalability issues.
- **API Optimization**: Review the API endpoints for possible improvements in performance, especially focusing on reducing the standard deviation in response times.
